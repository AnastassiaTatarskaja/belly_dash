## Overview

Rosaâ€™s Belly Dashboard presents the demographic information panel that illustrates the bacterial data for each volunteer. Volunteers are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
